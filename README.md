# Overview
In this project, our team has built a relational schema, established a database with a large data set from Federal Aviation Administration, and conducted data analysis.

# What I have learned
1. How to design a schema, create the database accordingly, and load data from csv files into database with RStudio.
2. How to execute database queries on the MySQL database to retrieve target information for data analysis.
3. How to analyze data, visualize results, and form a report.
