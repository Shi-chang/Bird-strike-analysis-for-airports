# Overview
In this project, our team has built a relational schema based on the large bird strike data from the Federal Aviation Adminstration of US, established and populated the  database on MySQL with the data set, designed queries on the database, and conducted data analysis.

# What I have learned
1. How to design a schema, create the database accordingly, and load data from csv files into database with RStudio.
2. How to execute database queries on the MySQL database to retrieve target information for data analysis.
3. How to analyze data, visualize results, and form a report.

# My contribution to the project
1. Designed Crow's Foot ERD, and then a logical model as a Crow's Feet Relational Schema.
2. Realised the schema in the MySQL database.
3. Load the CSV file into R and populate the tables with the data.
4. Formed the report.
